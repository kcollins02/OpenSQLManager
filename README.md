#OpenSQLManager

OpenSQLManager is an attempt to create an alternative to Navicat that is free and open. It is build with PHP-GTK, so I'm looking for a way to create normal binaries. 

### Planned Features
* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality
* Database table creation and backup 

The databases currently slated to be suported are:

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* SQLite
