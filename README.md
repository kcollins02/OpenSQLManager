#OpenSQLManager

OpenSQLManager is an attempt to create an alternative to Navicat that is free and open. It is build with PHP-GTK, so I'm looking for a way to create normal binaries. 

### Planned Features
* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality
* Database table creation and backup 

The databases currently slated to be suported are:

* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org)
* [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)
* [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/)

Plan to implement, not support:

* ODBC
* [Firebird](http://firebirdsql.org/)

### Won't Support
Closed source dbs, like Oracle, Sybase, MSSQL, etc.
